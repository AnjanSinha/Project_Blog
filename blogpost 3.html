            There’s nothing worse than that feeling of utter defeat and despair that comes along with making major mistakes in life and failing. It’s like having a dagger driven straight through your heart. Usually, we’re so blindsided by the error, that it takes
            months, if not years just to recover.
        </p>

            I know. Because I’ve been there. And more times than I would like to remember or even admit. And each time I went through one of life’s monumental mistakes, I wondered how I would forgive myself for it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="Cairo">
            Now, if you’re thinking to yourself that maybe these were minor mistakes and failures, then you’d be wrong. Each one decimated me to the core. And each time, I felt like I didn’t have the strength to move forward. Not emotionally. Not spiritually. Not
            mentally. And definitely not physically.
