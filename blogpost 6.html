            Self-care is a process of taking care of oneself with behaviors that promote health and active management of illness when it occurs. Both types of self-care (when healthy, when ill) are needed, as described further below. Everyone engages in some form
            of self-care daily with food choices, exercise, sleep, and dental care. Self-care is not new, although it has received increasing attention in recent years. Socrates has been credited with founding the self-care movement in ancient Greece,
            but care of oneself and loved ones has been the norm since human beings appeared on earth. Self-care remains a primary form of healthcare worldwide.Routine self-care is important for generally healthy people but self-care becomes essential
            when illness occurs. Chronic illness (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure) requires behaviors that control the illness, decrease symptoms, and improve survival such as medication adherence and symptom monitoring. An acute illness
            like an infection (e.g., COVID) requires the same types of self-care behaviors required of people with a chronic illness, but the medication adherence and symptom monitoring behaviors associated with an acute illness are typically short lived.
